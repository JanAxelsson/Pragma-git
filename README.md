Pragma-git
==========

 

"Pragma-git" is the friendly pragmatic git control app, fully compatible with
other git client softwares.

The difference to other git clients are:

-   small window — leaves more screen-space without hiding program

-   easy overview — you don’t need the branch diagrams in daily work

-   shows features when applicable — no confusion

-   uses external diff and merge tools — use your favourite

 

Git is an impressive toolbox with over 100 commands, and knowing what commands
to use makes the threshold to get started overwhelming.

 

The aim with Pragma-git is to be

-   ”pragmatic” — the antonym (opposite) to how some perceive ”git”; as being
    impractical, irrational, or unreasonable to work with.

-   just right — making the best features of the great git available with one
    click

-   watching out — guiding you through dangers of losing data
