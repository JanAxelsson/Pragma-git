Pragma-git
==========

 

"Pragma-git" is a friendly git control app with a small desktop window, fully
compatible with other git client softwares.

The difference to other git clients are:

-   small window — leaves more screen-space without hiding program

-   easy overview — you don’t need the branch diagrams in daily work

-   shows features when applicable —

-   uses external diff and merge tools — use your favourites

The aim is to be the opposite to how many percieve ”git” ("impractical
,irrational, unreasonable ,inefficient”)  — all opposites to the word
”pragmatic”.
