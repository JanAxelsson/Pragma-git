Pragma-git
==========

 

"Pragma-git" is the friendly pragmatic git control app, fully compatible with
other git client softwares.

The difference to other git clients are:

-   small window — leaves more screen-space without hiding program

-   easy overview — you don’t need the branch diagrams in daily work

-   shows features when applicable — do not show a button when it cannot be used

-   uses external diff and merge tools — use your favourite

 

Git is an impressive toolbox with over 100 commands, and that makes the
threshold to get started overwhelming

 

The aim with Pragma-git is to be

-   ”pragmatic” — the antonym (opposite) to how many perceive ”git” as being
    impractical, irrational, or unreasonable to work with.
