        <h4>Intro</h4>     
                       
            <p>The aim of this app is to be a user-friendly revision control client. 
             It fits people working on their own projects, or that find git overwhelming. 
             The app uses git behind the scene, and is therefore fully compatible and 
             can be used interchangeably together with other git softwares.
            </p>
            
         <h4>Drag and drop folder</h4>
            
            <p>Dragging a project's folder onto the app's window makes it available for version control.  
            If the folder is not prepared (as a git repository), the user is asked to allow the folder to be prepared.
            </p>       
            
            
         <h4>Store version with description </h4>
             
            <p>The current states of the project's files are given a text description, and stored by clicking the "STORE" button.
            This is in contrast to the complicated (*) sequence of git commands normally used. 
            </p>
