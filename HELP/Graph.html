The commit tree shows commits on the current branch in green, and commits on other branches as black. 
Note, the correct branch can only be deduced if the recommended settings "Merge without fast-forward" is used.

Moving the mouse pointer over the commit message, a grey shaddow appears, together with a checkbox.
<p>
    
</p>
Clicking on the commit makes the text green, and also shows this historical commit in the main window.  
The main window can be used as before, looking for changes, clicking on the modified files to get a list of changes to prior commit, etc.
<p>
    
</p>
Clicking the checkbox, makes the checked commit a fixed historical commit. Clicking on the text (not the checkbox) of any other commit
shows the second selected commit in the main window, and the modified file at the bottom of the main window indicates the difference
between these two commits.  Exactly the same as using the checkbox and the arrows directly in the main window.
